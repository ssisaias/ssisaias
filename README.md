## Hello

Name is Isaias, you can often find me around with that same username. I've been working with IT and programming since around 2013 . I'm a Bachelor of Software Engineering from Universidade Federal do Ceará.
I'm a self learner and also a reserved person. I like trying new techs, but my main stack currently is Java, Node, React/Native. I also do a little bit of Python when needed.
