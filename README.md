## Hello

Name is Isaias. I've been working with IT and programming since around 2013 . I'm a Bachelor of Software Engineering from Universidade Federal do Cear√°, self learner and also a reserved person. I like trying new techs, but my main stack currently is Node, ~~React/Native~~ Svelte/SvelteKit and Salesforce related techs.
